# sorta synth
A personal hackathon project for 2021-10-30. Learning how to make a basic GTK gui and how to produce tones with the alsa api from user input. I am looking to implement support for my wacom intuos tablet as input to the GTK app in the future. This program is not portable and will likely only work on my machine at the moment.
